print(""" Our young to-be thief was on a train with her mother and her brother, still blissfully unaware. 
Her mom and brother sat in front of her, and her brother was having a coughing fit courtesy of his cold. All of the 
sudden her brother stopped coughing and fell silent. The young book thief became worried and went to feel the head of 
the brother, it was stone cold...

As the impromptu funeral ceremony was coming to an end the young to-be thief spotted a glimpse of silver among the snow 
by the gravediggers. As everyone started to hurry out of the cold, the book thief grabbed what turned out to be a book
as her mother called her name. She forgot all about the black book and boarded back on the train where her mother was 
waiting. The train began to roll, and she all but forgot about the recent recent events and her brothers young demise. 

Buried beneath the folded layer of clothes in that suitcase was a small black book, which,
a fourteen-year-old grave digger in town had probably spent the last few hours
looking for. “I promise you,” he will say to his boss, “I have no idea what happened to it. I’ve looked
everywhere. Everywhere!” I’m sure he would never have suspected the young thief, and yet, there it was—a black book
with silver words written against the ceiling of her clothes.""")
