print(''' Our {} to-be thief was on a {} with her {} and her

{} book thief became worried and went to feel the head of the brother, it was stone cold...

As the impromptu funeral ceremony was coming to an end the {} to-be thief spotted a glimpse of {}
among the snow by the {}. As everyone started to hurry out of the {}, the book thief grabbed what
turned out to be a book as her {} called her name. She forgot all about the {}
book and boarded back on the train where her {} was waiting. The {} began to roll, and she 
all but forgot about the recent events and her brothers {} demise. 

Buried beneath the folded layer of clothes in that {} was a small {} book, which,
a {}-year-old {} in town had probably spent the last few {}
looking for. “I promise you,” he will say to his boss, “I have no idea what happened to it. I’ve looked
everywhere. Everywhere!” I’m sure he would never have suspected the {} thief, and yet, there it was—a 
{} book with {} words written against the {} of her
